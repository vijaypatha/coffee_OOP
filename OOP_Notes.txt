* What is Object Oriented Program?
Building programs around objects. Model real world object. Objects are virtual 'living things'.
Each "Thing" *has* something and *can* do something. Objects have data and functionality.
You make things (objects) from blue prints.

* Class is a blue print (Spiritual Creation).

* Constructor:
What Problem does constructor is solving?
How can i specify all the starting pieces of information when i create object from a class.
Constructor is part of the blueprint that allows us to specify what should happen when our object is being constructed.

Constructor is maker of Object.

* Self it a way for us to refer to the object that is going to be created from the class blueprint. Self is the object
being created.


* Objects are like people. Theyâ€™re living, breathing things that
- have knowledge inside them about how to do things (methods) and
- have memory inside them so they can remember things (attributes).

* Attributes are things that a object has. Basically variables.
* Methods are things that a object does. A function that is attached to an object is called method


Initialing is setting something to its starting value. Python creates space in memory to remember details of attributes
